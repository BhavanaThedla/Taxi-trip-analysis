#  Urban Taxi Demand & Trip Efficiency Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes urban taxi trip data to identify demand patterns, peak travel hours, and trip efficiency trends.
The goal is to transform raw trip records into actionable business insights using Python, SQL-style analysis, and Power BI visualization.

---

##  Business Problem

Urban transportation companies need visibility into:

* Peak demand hours
* Travel efficiency patterns
* Passenger behavior trends
* High-density pickup zones

This project builds an end-to-end analytics pipeline to support operational decision-making.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, data cleaning & feature engineering)
* SQL-style aggregation queries
* Power BI (dashboard & visualization)
* GitHub (project version control)

---

##  Project Workflow

1. Downloaded NYC taxi trip dataset from Kaggle
2. Cleaned and processed data using Python Pandas
3. Removed outliers and engineered time-based features
4. Created analytical tables for trips and locations
5. Built an executive dashboard in Power BI

---

##  Key Insights

* Evening hours (6–10 PM) show the highest taxi demand
* Peak demand periods experience longer trip durations, indicating congestion
* Most trips involve single passengers, suggesting ride-sharing opportunities
